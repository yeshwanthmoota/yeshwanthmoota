# 👋 Hi, I'm Yeshwanth Mootakoduru

I'm a student at UNC Charlotte, pursuing a master's in Cybersecurity, with a passion for machine learning, cybersecurity, and game development. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and am always eager to learn and grow.

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Developing skills in **Cybersecurity**, particularly **network security** and **cloud security (AWS)**.
- Building **Dockerized applications** for testing and simulations, including DDoS attacks and stress testing.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Deepening my expertise in **AWS cloud** services, with a focus on integrating **DevSecOps** practices to enhance security in cloud environments. I'm exploring the use of **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration within cloud ecosystems.
- Expanding my knowledge in **networking** and **penetration testing**, with a particular emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities and hacking into systems.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Currently Working On
### 🚀 **DDoS Docker Homelab**
I'm currently working on a **Docker** setup for simulating **DDoS attacks** and stress testing web servers. This project is aimed at enhancing cybersecurity exercises and evaluating web application performance under stress conditions.


## 💻 Previous Projects

### 🔒 **Blockchain and Cryptography**
- **Blockchain Implementation:** A project where I built a basic blockchain application with crucial features which can be used to understand how blockchain technology works.

### 🕹️ **Game Development**
I’ve created several Python-based games like:
- **Flappy Bird**
- **Space Invaders**
- **Snake Game**
- **Enderman Adventure**

These showcase my ability to implement game mechanics, algorithms, and user interface designs from scratch.

### 🧠 **Machine Learning & AI**
- **Neural Networks for Binary Classification:** A project where I built a neural network from scratch for binary classification tasks.
